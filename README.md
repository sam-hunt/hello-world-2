# hello-world-2
A small introductory static site hosted up at [samhunt.dev](https://samhunt.dev)
Replaces an older template-based site built with Hugo

Hosts a number of toy projects/pages:
1. A pure javascript path finder over a css grid, working up to A* (why!)
2. A slice of covers from my book collection for people interested in borrowing
2. A leaflet display of Rimworld colony renders

More details on leaflet tile generation for rimworld in subdirectory readme
